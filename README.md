My name is Oscar and I am passionate about music, sports and technology. I’ve played the piano & drums for over 6 years. Ever since I can remember I’ve had an interest in technology and computers. I find the endless capabilities of IT very intriguing. Now more than ever, IT is a part of our lives and in the future, it will be even more so. 

I expect to further my understanding of information technology throughout this course. My area of expertise is with building and troubleshooting computers and I took this course to help me increase my knowledge and expand my skill set.

Here is the listing for my ideal job:

This role is a sales and IT troubleshooting job. I am experienced in troubleshooting computer issues and I believe I would enjoy working in this position for that reason.

This job requires a driven and adaptable individual with at least 3 years experience in a sales role. This position also requires someone with a solid background working with IT, software, technology & hardware. It requires you to be confident, helpful and approachable working with customers.

I have the following relevant skills, qualifications and experience:
Thorough understanding of building computers and hardware
Understanding of Windows
Efficient computer use
Capable of typing at 126 words per minute

In order for me to get this job I need to get more experience working with customers as a sales representative. I need to increase my understanding of computer software and/or programming. 

To get the required experience I would start by working as an entry level sales representative. I would further my IT knowledge by continuing study with RMIT.

Personal Profile
Myers-Briggs test result: INFJ-A
Learning style test result: Auditory learner
The Big Five test result:  


The results of these tests show that I am organized, dependable, conscientious, agreeable, compassionate, co-operative and enjoy intellectual stimulation. It also shows that I learn best through listening and observing. 

This means that in a team/environment I get along well with others and am driven and self disciplined. I enjoy being challenged and working to  overcome obstacles in order to reach a common goal. 

When forming a team, these test results show that I shouldn’t be a leader but rather someone who focuses and gets the work done. 

### Project Idea - Overview
My project idea is a solar powered smartphone charger case. It will use solar energy to charge the connected device and store excess energy in the built-in battery. This device will be useful when a standard charger isn’t available and it will be easy to transport with you wherever you go. With enough sunlight, it will take roughly 1 year of use and charging for the device to pay itself off in reduced electricity bills. With the latest solar panel technology, it will take roughly 2 hours to fully charge an average smartphone using this case if there is sufficient sunlight.

### Project Idea - Motivation
The best thing about this device is it’s environmental carbon footprint or perhaps the lack thereof. Instead of using electricity to charge the device, the enormous energy supply of the sun will be used to power phones. This will as a result mean that electricity use goes down and therefore carbon emissions go down as well. One of the biggest issues with a device like this would be manufacturing the panels themselves which has been the topic of much controversy in regards to the impact on the environment, but with the latest technology this issue is much smaller than it once was.

### Project Idea - Description
This device will be designed to comfortably fit onto most modern smartphones. It will contain a solar panel on the outside, a battery beneath the panel, a small circuit board and a connection to the device itself in order to supply the electricity. 
One of the biggest issues with something like this is that it requires sunlight in order to work; something which isn’t always available everywhere. A product like this would work well in Australia where there is plenty of sunlight even during the winter but that is much less the case in many other places. 
The builtin battery helps the problem of inconsistent sunlight throughout the day. When your device is fully charged, if there is enough sunlight and the panels are generating excess energy, it will be stored in the builtin battery. This is a must-have for a system like this. 
Another feature of this device is on the software side of things. There will be an app that links with the case and can show things such as the current charge and an estimated time till full charge using the recent charging rate and local sunlight data. The battery percentage and current power draw of the phone will be visible on a small led screen built into the case regardless of whether or not an app is used. This will be difficult to implement but will definitely add another layer of convenience. The app will also help find areas with most sunlight in order to be as efficient as possible.
Another product would be a standalone solar powered battery/charger. This would have all of the same app connectivity as the charger case. This would be separate from the phone and be much larger than the aforementioned solar powered charger case. As a result, it would be able to collect and store much more energy. The available use cases for something like this are much more robust as it would be able to supply up to 100 watts (of course depending on the available sunlight). It could be used for powering things such as a TV whilst camping or even a small refrigerator. This device will include a regular wall charger incase sunlight isn’t available and you simply want to use it as a charger/power source.
Project Idea - Tools and Technologies
This device will need an automated system in place to direct energy to the builtin battery when the connected device is fully charged. It will also need to be able to see the current battery charge and estimate how long until full charge using local sunlight data. It would need a solar panel, battery, some wires and circuit board for some basic logic. 

### Project Idea - Skills required
A project like this requires a good understanding of welding, tinkering, wiring and programming. It will require software for the app and some basic logic builtin to the circuit board to route power to either the battery or the phone depending on the phone’s current battery percentage. Gaining these skills will be difficult and time consuming but doable. 

### Project Idea - Outcome
If this project succeeds, carbon emissions will go down and people will save money on electricity bills. Depending on the success of something like this, it could start a wave of many new solar powered things which is vital in the long term sustainability of the planet. On top of that, it could result in many people realising the serious impact of carbon emissions and global warming, which many experts believe will eventually be the cause of human extinction. If everyone switched to solar powered smartphones, it wouldn’t in itself solve global warming but is definitely a step in the right direction.
